# üìú Dual License Migration Plan

## Overview

Starting with **v2.6.0** (planned Q4 2026), NEF to JPG Converter will transition from MIT License to a Dual License model:

1. **AGPLv3** - Free for open source and personal use
2. **Commercial License** - For proprietary/commercial use

## Timeline

- **v2.1.0 - v2.5.x** (2025-2026): Remains MIT Licensed
- **v2.6.0+** (Q4 2026): Dual License (AGPLv3 + Commercial)

## Why This Change?

As the project matures and gains enterprise adoption, we want to:
- ‚úÖ Continue supporting the open source community
- ‚úÖ Ensure improvements flow back to the community
- ‚úÖ Generate revenue from commercial use to fund development
- ‚úÖ Provide professional support for businesses

## What This Means

### For Open Source Users (AGPLv3)
**‚úÖ You can continue to:**
- Use NEF Converter for free
- Modify the source code
- Distribute your modifications
- Use it in open source projects

**‚ö†Ô∏è You must:**
- Share your modifications under AGPLv3
- If you offer it as a service (SaaS), make your code public
- Provide attribution

### For Commercial Users (Commercial License)
**üí∞ Purchase a commercial license if you want to:**
- Integrate into closed-source/proprietary software
- Offer as a paid service without sharing code
- Remove AGPLv3 obligations
- Get priority support

**Pricing (to be determined):**
- Small Business: $X/year
- Enterprise: $X/year
- Lifetime License: $X (one-time)
- Custom/OEM: Contact us

## Grandfathering

**All versions before v2.6.0 remain MIT licensed forever:**
- v2.1.0 through v2.5.x: MIT License (no restrictions)
- You can continue using these versions under MIT
- No retroactive license changes

## FAQ

### Can I still use older versions under MIT?
**Yes!** All versions v2.5.x and earlier remain MIT licensed forever.

### What if I'm already using it commercially?
Versions before v2.6.0 are MIT, so no restrictions. For v2.6.0+, you'll need a commercial license or use AGPLv3.

### Can I fork the last MIT version?
Yes! You can fork v2.5.x and maintain it under MIT. However, you cannot merge v2.6.0+ changes without respecting the new license.

### What about contributors?
Contributors to v2.6.0+ agree to the new dual license. We may introduce a CLA (Contributor License Agreement).

### Will there be community edition features?
Yes! Core functionality remains in AGPLv3 version. Premium features may be commercial-only.
