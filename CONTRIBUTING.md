# Contributing to NEF to JPG Converter

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the NEF to JPG Converter as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Install development dependencies**: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Add tests** for your changes
5. **Run the test suite**: `pytest`
6. **Ensure code quality**: `black src tests && isort src tests && flake8 src tests`
7. **Commit your changes** with a clear commit message
8. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nef-to-jpg.git
cd nef-to-jpg

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev,docs,security]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pre-commit install
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_converter.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- **flake8** for linting
- **mypy** for type checking

```bash
# Format code
black src tests

# Sort imports
isort src tests

# Lint code
flake8 src tests

# Type checking
mypy src

# Run all quality checks
black src tests && isort src tests && flake8 src tests && mypy src
```

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Test with different Python versions locally if possible
- Mock external dependencies (like actual NEF files) in unit tests

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description of what is being tested."""
    # Arrange
    setup_data = "test_data"
    
    # Act
    result = function_to_test(setup_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected_result
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you're changing functionality
2. **Add tests** for new features or bug fixes
3. **Ensure all tests pass** locally
4. **Update the README.md** if needed
5. **Write a clear PR description** explaining your changes
6. **Link to any related issues**
7. **Request review** from maintainers

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new conversion option`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in batch processing`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `test: add tests for CLI module`
- `refactor: improve error handling`
